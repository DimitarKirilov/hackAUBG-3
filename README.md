## CityAPI

**Problem**

We know cities generate and store a constant stream of data:

-   Traffic
-   Waste
-   Air quality
-   Crime
-   Weather

The issue is not in collecting and storing this data, but in processing it in a timely manner to derive actionable insights.

**Our Solution**

This is where CityAPI comes in, a tool that leverages multiple city data sources to serve a particular business vertical - Insurance, Medical, etc

-   Traffic
-   Crime

Our insurance module provides Insurance companies with the ability to check real-time Traffic [Crime, Air Quality] data for citizens via an easy to use API. Insurance companies input the client's demographics and we return Traffic [Crime and Medical] risk. This allows Insurance companies to offer segmented pricing, which in turn benefits citizens with optimised policy costs.
Example: A citizen who lives in a neighborhood with few accident-prone intersections will pay less for his car insurance, compared to a citizen that lives in a high-accident, high-crime district
